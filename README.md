# Latte: A New Perspective in Java Project Development

Many dream of diving into Java project development, but often find themselves lost and intimidated by the language when they start learning. Questions like "How to create a project?", "What are classes?", "How to compile?", and the perplexity between Maven and Gradle can be overwhelming. The main question remains - how to learn it all? Java presents a daunting syntax, a myriad of obscure buttons, and numerous other challenges that discourage beginners from continuing their learning journey. In contrast, languages like Python are fast, lightweight, have a clear syntax, and are notably easy to learn. However, Python falls short in handling many features and functionalities specific to Java, such as creating plugins for Minecraft and compiling them into .jar format, which is literally impossible.

Introducing Latte - the solution to this problem. Latte is a hybrid programming language based on Python. It allows for the easy creation of Java projects while maintaining a lightweight syntax, an intuitive interface, and most importantly, ease of language comprehension. Latte ensures that even a complete novice can grasp how to create a project without the struggles associated with Java. While Latte is currently tailored for writing Minecraft plugins, this serves as its primary focus. Nevertheless, it's also possible to create a regular Java project effortlessly. In essence, it's a brilliant concept that I am eager to bring to life with my efforts!

## Tutorial:

1. Launch IntCode (IDE for Latte).
2. Click on "New Project," then "New Latte Project," and create your project.
3. In the opened window, choose "Minecraft Plugin."
4. Enter the necessary details; for example:
   - Project Name: "HelloPlayer"
   - Author: "watakak"
   - Version of Plugin: 1.0
   - Description: "Greets the player upon entering the server. Also contains two commands."
5. All set! Now your project structure will look something like this:
   - LatteProjects
     -- HelloPlayer
       --- HelloPlayer.latte
       --- plugin.yml
6. Let's start writing code! Here's a sample Latte code:

```python
nickname = player.name

on starting():
    console.print('Plugin enabled!')

on working():
    on player.join():
        player.print(f'Welcome to the server, {nickname}!')
    if player type '/hello':
        player.print('Hello!')
    elif player type '/hello all' -p 'HelloPlayer.helloall':
        server.print('Hello, everyone!')

on stopping():
    server.print('Server is going to stop in the next 3 seconds!')
    wait(3)
    console.print('Plugin disabled.')
```

7. Done! Now you can press the "Build" button in our IDE.
   Later in the path:
   - LatteProjects
     -- HelloPlayer
       --- Builds
         ---- HelloPlayer-1.0.jar
       --- HelloPlayer.latte
       --- plugin.yml

8. That's it! You can now transfer the .jar file to your Minecraft server and run it. You've learned how to write plugins for your Minecraft server using Latte!

In conclusion, Latte is a relatively new, user-friendly, and lightweight language for coding, designed to be intuitive for programming novices. With Latte, beginners can cultivate their interest in both Python and Java coding and bring their projects to life. Until we meet again!
